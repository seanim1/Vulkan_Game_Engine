# Vulkan_Renderer (Real-Time)

Completely based on the tutorial of Brendan Galea upto part 27 ( https://www.youtube.com/c/BrendanGalea )

Here are some features:
  - Blinn-Phong Material
  - Multiple point lights
  - Loading .obj files
  - Alpha blending / Transparency (Limitation: the order of objects matter)
  - Controller for rotation and translation of objects

How to install: 

Download the library folder from here ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/15m8Zy_3O-bI-ZHLOx-pMszVTMwiW3r5k/view?usp=sharing ), then place the "Libraries" folder in the ( Game_Engine_Vulkan/Game_Engine_Vulkan/ ) directory.

The libraries include:
  - Vulkan
  - GLFW
  - glm
  - tiny_obj_loader

I do feel as though I have spent way too much time trying to learn Vulkan, when it was not the right tool for me, yet.

The purpose of this repo is to serve as a proof that I watched and followed Brendan Galea's tutorial, and of course education.
