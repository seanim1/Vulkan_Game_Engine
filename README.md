# Vulkan_Renderer

Completely based on the tutorial of Brendan Galea upto part 27 ( https://www.youtube.com/c/BrendanGalea )

Upon opening it, it renders a cube with Blinn-Phong Material.

This project serves as as an evidence that I watched and followed Brendan Galea's tutorial.

Most useful thing it can do at the moment is applying transformation matrices to a cube.
I do not recommend downloading it.

Thanks!
