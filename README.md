# Vulkan_Renderer

Completely based on the tutorial of Brendan Galea upto part 27 ( https://www.youtube.com/c/BrendanGalea )

Upon opening it, it renders a cube with Blinn-Phong Material.

The purpose of this repo is to simply say that I watched and followed Brendan Galea's tutorial.

Most useful thing it can do at the moment is applying transformation matrices to a cube.
I do not recommend downloading it.

I honestly feel like I have spent way too much time trying to learn Vulkan, when it was not the right tool for me.

How to install: 
Download the library folder from here ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/15m8Zy_3O-bI-ZHLOx-pMszVTMwiW3r5k/view?usp=sharing ), then place the "Libraries" folder in the Game_Engine_Vulkan/Game_Engine_Vulkan/ directory.
